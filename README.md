AMIRIS is an agent-based simulation of electricity markets and their actors. Check out its [full documentation](https://gitlab.com/dlr-ve/esy/amiris/amiris/-/wikis/home).

## What is AMIRIS?

AMIRIS enables you to simulate the interplay between electricity market actors, policy instruments, and scenarios.
Due to its prototypical definition of agents, you can model decisions on a high level and simulate transnational electricity systems, e.g., Europe.
At the same time you can also model very detailed decisions, e.g. of households.
Whatever you do: Thanks to the powerful framework [FAME](https://gitlab.com/fame-framework/wiki/-/wikis/home), AMIRIS will deliver results quickly: The typical **runtime is less than a minute** for one year and one market zone in hourly resolution.

Below is an overview of the agents modelled in AMIRIS. The figure illustrates the associated flows of information, energy and money.

## Who is AMIRIS for?

AMIRIS is intended for informed users in the energy domain, such as students, researchers, and companies in the sector.
Although not strictly necessary, [Basic Knowledge of Electricity Markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_market#Wholesale_electricity_market) is helpful, e.g. regarding market clearing concepts.

## Applications

The development of AMIRIS started in 2008.
Since then, AMIRIS has seen many different applications. 
Selected recent applications:

- In [TradeRES](https://traderes.eu/) AMIRIS was used to analyse cost recovery of renewables in ~100% renewable electricity systems under different **Energy Policy Instruments**. [Paper](https://doi.org/10.1109/EEM60825.2024.10608886)
- Intertwined dynamics between **Energy Community Markets** and national electricity markets were analysed with AMIRIS. [Paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egyr.2024.06.052)
- Interactions of **Household Flexibility** (heat pumps, electric vehicles, and electricity storage units) with the German energy system were modelled with AMIRIS. [Paper](https://elib.dlr.de/207802)
- In project VERMEER **Impacts of Cold Dunkelflaute** events on the European electricity system were investigated using **Market Coupling** in AMIRIS. [Paper](https://zenodo.org/records/10561382) [Report](https://elib.dlr.de/196641/)
- AMIRIS was used to assess the **Economic Potential of Large Flexibility Providers** in future electricity market scenarios. [Paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.est.2024.110959)
- **Monetary Saving Potentials of Load Shifting** were analysed using AMIRIS. [Dissertation](https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/items/4a364bac-9e97-4d35-8eb6-645824cfc02d)
- A wide range of scenarios for **Future Electricity Markets** was explored using an AMIRIS [scenario generator](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8382789). [Paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egyr.2024.11.013)

## Non-Applications

AMIRIS follows an explorative approach: it is well suited to investigate the effects that arise from the interactions of energy system actors under a given set of assumptions.
While individual actors can optimise their decisions, AMIRIS **does not optimise the energy system** as a whole, nor does AMIRIS enforce system-wide constraints, such as carbon emission caps.
Therefore, to answer questions like "What is the cheapest possible electricity system given a maximum carbon emission of X?", we recommend to use optimisation-based tools, e.g. [REMix](https://gitlab.com/dlr-ve/esy/remix/framework), [PyPSA](https://pypsa.org/) or [oemof](https://oemof.org/).
